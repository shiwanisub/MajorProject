              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Founded in 2020, Swornim began with a simple yet powerful vision: to make event planning accessible,
                affordable, and stress-free for everyone in Nepal. We recognized the challenges people faced when
                organizing events - from finding reliable vendors to managing multiple bookings and payments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our platform bridges the gap between customers and service providers, creating a thriving ecosystem
                where quality vendors can showcase their services and customers can easily find exactly what they need
                for their special occasions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we're proud to be Nepal's most trusted event management platform, having facilitated thousands of
                successful events across the country. From intimate family gatherings to grand corporate events, we've
                been part of countless memorable moments.
